Igo.js is a full-featured Node.js web framework for developing web applications.

In a few seconds, it provides a working pre-configured development environment.

### Introduction

We love Node.js, it's a fantastic and easy technology to build and run web applications.
But after building a few projects, we found that it was a pain to duplicate these many *technical* files:
- `app.js` for Express and its bunch of middlewares, plus the configuration for these middlewares,
- `Gulpfile.js` to have a nice development environment,
- MySQL, Redis, SMTP configurations and connections,
- `package.json` with so many dependencies,
- `Mocha` configuration and tools to write good tests,
- ...etc.

After several months, and more projects duplicating the same configuration and the same technical stack, well, it appeared clearly that all this had very little added value.

That's how Igo.js was born.

### How it works
Igo applications are standard Node.js applications, for which:
- Igo includes about 40 common libraries (like Express, i18next, Gulp, etc), for development and for production.
- Igo embeds a default configuration for your Express app, for Gulp, Mocha, ... and lets you add your own configuration.
- Igo provides also some tools like a Mailer, an Error handler, a basic ORM...

### Configuration
The Igo configuration can be found in `/app/config.js` file.
The configuration is initialized at startup, and can be retrieved through igo module:
```js
var config = require('igo').config`;
```

Some configuration parameters can be defined with environment variables. Igo uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), so you can just add variables to a `/.env` file.

```txt
# development database
MYSQL_DATABASE=mydatabase
```
## Framework

### MVC
Igo uses:
- A basic custom ORM for MySQL, inspired by [Rails ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
- [Dust](http://www.dustjs.com/), a powerful and performant template engine, maintained by LinkedIn
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/), the most widely used Node.js web framework

ðŸŒ€ For detailed documentation, see [Models](/docs/models.md), [Views](/docs/views.md) and [Controllers](/docs/controllers.md).

### Extra Features

- See Igo [Cache](/docs/cache.md)

## Development
Igo uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) with these modules:
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to auto-refresh the server on code change
- [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) to verify the quality of your backend Javascript code
- [Bower](https://bower.io) to download and install frontend modules
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/) or [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor
- [Uglify](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/) to compress and minify your frontend Javascript code
- [Livereload](https://github.com/vohof/gulp-livereload) to refresh your browser automatically

ðŸŒ€ See the [Development](/docs/development.md) section to learn more.

## Test
Igo uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework, and offers more features:
- Testing controllers layer with [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)
- Automatic test database reinitialization before first test
- Test isolation: each test runs in a transaction that is rollbacked

ðŸŒ€ See the [Test](/docs/test.md) section to learn more.


## Production
- Igo dev dependencies are packaged in a separate module [igo-dev](https://github.com/arnaudm/igo-dev)
- Production configuration is loaded separately
- Runtime errors are caught and can be sent by email to the admin
- Igo logger uses [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) so you can log where you like (eg: [papertrail](https://github.com/kenperkins/winston-papertrail))

ðŸŒ€ See the [Production](/docs/production.md) section to learn more.
