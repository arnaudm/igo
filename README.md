## ðŸš€ Getting Started (2 minutes)

Before using Igo, you need to install Node.js (>=5.9.1), Bower, Gulp and Mocha.
```sh
npm install -g bower gulp-cli mocha
```

Then, the easiest way to get started with Igo is to create a new project via the `igo` CLI.

```sh
npm install -g igo
igo create myproject && cd myproject
npm install && bower install
gulp
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start coding (and reading [the docs](/docs/README.md)).

Type ```mocha``` to run tests.
