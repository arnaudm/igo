# igo: a full-featured web framework

Note: Work is In Progress.

## Presentation

The igo framework comes with :
- expressjs with pre-configured middlewares
- [dustjs](http://www.dustjs.com/) as a template engine
- a basic ORM for mysql
- simple configuration management
- a simple error handling system
- cache API based on Redis
- mailer system based on [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer)

For development, [igo-dev](https://github.com/arnaudm/igo-dev) offers :
- a few pre-configured [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks
- a testing environment based on [mochajs](https://mochajs.org/)

igo uses a lot of async, lodash.
<br />
igo does not use ES6 nor Promises.
